# Full Stack Banking App

## Description
This is a programming exercise, using the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to demonstrate building the basic components and logic for a banking app, both front-end and back-end. This app's primary features include pages for: Create an Account, Login, Deposit, Withdraw, and View Balance. This was originally our Week 21 Portfolio assignment in the MIT xPro MERN course, but I'm continuing to develop and refactor it for our Week 27 assignment. I'm also working on adding user authentication to the app. This has been an excellent tutorial in developing a complete, albeit basic, full MERN stack app. Additional future improvements to the functionality are listed below, under Roadmap.

## Installation / Usage
To run this app on a local server, clone or download all of the files within this repository to your local machine. Then, run 'npm install', then 'npm start' in your terminal. 

## Roadmap
- This current version has very basic authentication . I would like to upgrade the authentication and authorization byt using Firebase Authentication.
